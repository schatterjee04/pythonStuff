        A note on scoring, since it was not clearly denoted in the slides/notes, I referred to the wikipedia article here:

        Accordingly, for each cell in the matrix, there is a U, L and D score denoting the sum of the cell score given
        an upper to lower, a left to right, or a diagonal summation.
