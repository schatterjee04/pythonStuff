DAFAQ am I supposed to do here?!
Well... I have training data and test data for a single value test case
annndddd I have a multivariate scenario. Real data? Even more complex.
How do I train my system and how do I compute the regression?

I guess the first thing to be done is to load the various files and
parse the content into their respective lists.
